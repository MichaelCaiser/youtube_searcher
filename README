YouTube Searcher 

This is a an Android app I wrote that allows the user to search YouTube videos by keyword.

It requests a JSON response from YouTube, parses the JSON response, and displays the responses in a ListView.

The app calls the YouTube native app to play the video.

The app is stil a work in progress.  I'm working on some issues with calling the native app.
